95898009,4,The view was great. But the room had to be recleaned when we got in. Great time though.,0

95898020,4,Pretty good resort overall. One thing I didn't like was the spa. The spa was weirdly cold.,0
95898021,1,I paid for an ocean view room and I can only see a sliver of the water? What a scam!,1
95898022,1,The food at the restaurant was horrid! I can't believe I had to pay sixty dollars on a dry aged slab of garbage!,1

95898025,5,The best part is staff. They really show that great hospitality.,0

95898035,5,So fancy! The beach was so pretty!,0
95898036,1,This was the worst experience in a resort I've ever been to. The spa was lackluster and the water was harsh on my body. I just wanted to relax but now I have skinflakes from this establishment.,1
95898037,5,"The Presidential Suite was amazing. It housed my party greatly and with such fast staff, it was an amazing experience",0
95898038,1,Down right awful. I can't believe that the room was not cleaned before our arrival.,1
95898039,1,The banquet we were supposed to have was ruined by poor service. Absolutely terrible.,1
95898040,1,The front desk was so rude. We wanted to dispute our bill but they gave us so much attitude.,1

95898047,5,This is the best place to be. On a beautiful beach sipping sangria. ,0

95898057,5,Absolutely mind-blowing. I have never been at a resort that was so hospitable.,0

95898060,4,"Value wise, it is not the best. Regardless, it was still a fun time",0
95898061,1,"It was so noisy. I know it's not the hotel's fault for the noise, but they declined to address my concerns and were not at all accommodating.",1
95898062,3,This resort was just adequate. Nothing too special. ,0
95898063,1,What a waste. Our sheets were not pressed and the view was not what we asked for.,1
95898064,1,Awful. It rained during our stay and the hotel had nothing to offer us to do. Our family was devestated.,1
95898065,2,This review is two stars solely because the staff was great. Everything else was down the drain. Especially the spa which was despicable.,1
95898066,1,That is no spa. To charge such high prices for low-quality treatment is outrageous. Never again.,1
95898067,5,My anniversary here with my husband was the best. Thank you!,0
95898068,5,I will return here! The beach is really something else here!,0

95898071,5,Great menu options for both food and drink! Will never get over how amazing this place is.,0

95898076,4,Our conference was a success and it was really pleasant.,0
95898077,4,Really standard experience. The food and drink was the best part. My favorite was the seasonal fish.,0
95898078,3,The food was outstanding. The best steak I 've had in a long time. The spa though was atrocious. This place needs to step up their spa game.,0
95898079,5,Everyone was so helpful! I can't thank the staff enough for taking care my every request.,0
95898080,5,Pleasant and beautiful place overall. All of the staff had smiles on their faces and always made my day.,0
95898081,4,Good service and food. Our room was not resrocked when we first arrived.,0
95898082,3,The room was just okay. It seemed a little run down and our AC would give out. Everything else was impeccable.,0
95898083,1,What a beautiful hellscape. It's so pretty coupled with terrible service and disgusting food.,1
95898084,1,Overpriced and filthy. Your check in is so slow and the rooms we were put in were all riddled with crumbs and dust.,1
95898085,1,My TV was broken and the maintenance team was inconsiderate.,1
95898086,5,The staff are the highlight of this place. So accommodating and helpful.,0
95898087,1,I will not be coming back. I have mobility handicaps and I was rushed out of my room for check out. Everything was great until that point.,1
95898088,4,Really pleasant and fun. Just a bit pricey,0
95898089,1,This place has me so upset. Housekeeping did a horrible clean of my room and went into my room with my do not disturb sign on the door.,1
95898090,5,Exceeded my expectations. The ribeye and old fashioned is so delicious.,0
95898091,4,This is a fun resort with good amenities. I enjoyed my stay.,0
95898092,1,The spa was so bad. I can't believe how unprofessional and unkept the spa is.,1

95898097,5,The boutique stores are so cute! I love the gifts that you have to sell!,0
95898098,4,Pricey but worth it!,0
95898099,1,I sent my food back three times because each time it was overcooked. Also my server was outright mean to me.,1
95898100,1,"The spa staff were so uncaring. I understand if it's busy, but they simply did not want to help with my simplest requests.",1
95898101,5,The chicken taco special was amazing! Poolside is the way to go!,0

95898108,5,The spicy margaritas and other cocktails are really delicious.,0
95898109,5,What an amazing experience. I will never forget these past few days.,0
95898110,1,I am absolutely infuriated. I paid for a spa package for them to tell me I can't use it because it was overbooked. Unprofessional.,1
95898111,4,The breakfast buffet was amazing even though a bit pricey.,0
95898112,5,"If I could, I would stay here indefinitely. It is very beautiful with really good food, drinks, and amenities.",0
95898113,5,The beach is so relaxing. To be able to order drinks poolside is even better.,0
95898114,4,Everything was good. The room view was a little underwhelming though.,0
95898115,1,My room was filthy upon arrival and it took 30 minutes for someone just to come and barely clean it.,1

95898119,4,"The spa was a little underwhelming, but overall it was a great time.",0
95898120,5,My experience here was simply the best. The mushroom risotto was absolutely the best dish I had here.,0

95898125,4,It was a fun experience to be here with the family. The beach was nice and everyone was very sweet to us.,0
95898126,1,Our experience was not at all what we hoped. The food was awful and our room was a mess. I can't believe how much we spent and how little value we received.,1
95898127,1,"This was atrocious. I don't like to complain, but this was really one of the worst experiences I've had. No one came to our aid when we needed it, everything felt dirty, and none of the amenities were even at par.",1
95898128,5,Really great! I have no complaints and I will we back with my friends and family.,0
95898129,4,Wonderful place. A little bit outdated but still a good beach place to relax.,0
95898130,5,Never thought I'd experience anything like this. Truly outstanding!,0

95898134,5,Lovely job all around. I love this place and I never want to leave!,0
95898135,1,"It's really bad. I was told that there were so many great things about this resort and nothing has been even remotely positive. The food is bad, the spa amenities are broken, and it's just not a good time. this place needs to be better.",1
95898136,4,"Pretty good I will say. The food, especially breakfast here, is pretty special.",0

95898139,4,Great experience for great value. Much love goes out to this resort.,0
95898140,5,Our wedding party enjoyed every aspect of this resort. The catering expecially was amazing along with the bar cocktails that were prepared for us.,0
95898141,1,Never again will we come here. Repeatedly have we asked to get our room cleaned for the staff to only steam our sheets and nothing else. There is no care here for the guests.,1
95898142,5,Such a beautiful place! The concierge was especially helpful as they provided everything we needed in a timely manner.,0
95898143,1,The front desk was awful. I don’t understand why you would hire such terrible front desk staff that do not care about guest experience..,1
95898144,1,I feel sick after being here. The outdoor food stand made me feel sick along with the dirty rooms. It's like the vents aren't clean.,1
95898145,1,The spa is the reason why you are getting a poor rating. Fix your amenities and train your staff better.,1
95898146,5,Lovely resort. I will always be happy coming here! The staff as always take care of my family and I.,0
95898147,1,"Dirty. For paying over 700 dollars a night, it at minimum needs to be clean.",1
95898148,5,Really beautiful views and accommodating staff. Good job!,0
95898149,4,Our business meeting went according to plan and the service provided was more than adequate. Thank you!,0
95898150,5,We are so appreciative of everything the staff does here. They are truly the stars of the resort.,0
95898151,1,What a distasteful experience! Everything is so overpriced with the lackluster service!,1
95898152,5,Your services here are unparalleled! The beach is the best part about this resort.,0

95898160,5,The staff and service is unbeatable here!,0
95898161,4,Rooms were unclean when we came in but the housekeeping made it brand new. The front desk apologized and made it up by providing free amenities. They really do go above and beyond.,0
95898162,5,The pool was really nice to have the kids be out there and play. Definitely a highlight.,0
95898163,5,The hotel amenities that were beachside cannot be beaten here.,0
95898164,5,I want to be here all the time. It is so beautiful and the staff here really are caring.,0
95898165,4,Really great. The meeting we had was taken care of nicely with the food and drink provided.,0
95898166,1,This was an upsetting find of a resort. Our rooms were not cleaned properly. We relocated three times to new rooms and each and every time our rooms were filthy.,1
95898167,3,"It was a nice stay overall. The spa however, was definitely not the best, but it was made up by the fact that it was beautiful and things were taken care of quickly.",0
95898168,1,"You all need to do better. If I can't enjoy my dinner in peace, then there is no way I am returning. Things need to be handled here. It should not be expected for the guest to take care of their own problems.",1
95898169,1,Gross and awful. The spa made me so angry and there was nothing to accommodate my dietary restrictions.,1
95898170,2,This resort was a letdown. The spa was not good and the in room dining service was just okay. It is a very beautiful place but that's all it is. It’s just a ,1
95898171,1,"My bags were lost, the front desk were incredibly rude, and the bar food and drink that you tried to make it up with was just downright terrible. Never again will I stay here.",1
95898172,5,I will be back. This is amazing with all of the innovative food items at the pool and the lovely amenities.,0
95898173,5,This resort is such a great time! I can't believe how beautiful it is and amazing the staff are.,0
95898174,1,The spa is absolutely awful. I can't believe you charge over 90 dollars for mediocre massages.,1
95898175,5,Wow! This is all I can say because everything is so perfect! I love the aesthetic!,0
95898176,5,I cannot begin to describe the amazing time we had. Absolutely breathtaking.,0
95898177,5,The food was impeccable. The seafood specials that were provided were absolutely phenomenal.,0
95898178,4,This a lovely spot to host any type of event. The event staff really do a great job and the amenitites to provide to event guests are nice as well.,0
95898179,5,The concierge team provided so much and made it such a personal and lovely stay for my family and I. I can't thank them enough.,0
95898180,5,Thank you for the great time!,0
95898181,4,Lovely place. The breakfast buffest is definitely the place to be to pick yourself back up.,0
95898182,4,Pretty good resort overall! I was pleasntly surprised about the service and their efficiency!,0
95898183,3,Standard resort with good amentities. It's pretty confusing to navigate though.,0
95898184,5,It's such a good place to be with friends and family. They even have beach amenities for guests!,0
95898185,5,It can't get better. The poolside bar is definitely my go to when I come back.,0
95898186,4,The staff was wonderful here. ,0
95898187,3,"It was a good stay. Unfortunately, my room was messy when we came in and the in room dining was not good",0
95898188,1,Awful! Don't provide in-room dining anymore. Everything was disgusting.!,1
95898189,1,"To be frank, this was an awful stay hosted by an incompent front desk team. You can't tell me what I experienced here when I was the one who experienced it. You are downright in the wrong and need to be fired.",1
95898190,1,It's not good. I had high hopes and I was wrong. Your team needs to do better in providing better service.,1
95898191,5,I can't wait to come back here and take my family to your beach! It's so much fun!,0
95898192,1,How do I get bumped off of my spa treatment? What kind of place are you running here?,1
95898193,4,This is such a fun resort. There are things I would change but overall it was pleasant!,0
95898194,1,"I really don't like to complain, but when there are bugs and hair in our supposedly clean room, something needs to be said. ",1
95898195,5,I can't thank you all enough for how wonderful you made my birthday party here!,0
95898196,4,What a great place to be in the summer. The amenities around the hotel itself are very fun.,0
95898197,1,Grossly overrated hotel. The service alone is not deserving of anything higher than a 1 star rating.,1
95898198,1,Your staff is so pretentious. I simply ask a question about the menu and they scoff at me as if I did something wrong. Train your people to be better. This was the worst experience I have ever had in my life.,1
95898199,5,Simply world class! You guys do everything right here!,0
95898200,4,Really great resort with lovely food options. The drinks made at the bar are especially delicious.,0
95898201,4,Really cool place. Very beauttiful!,0
95898202,5,Thank you!,0
95898203,4,Really great experience to be here!,0
95898204,1,Never again will my family and I come here. This place was overpriced and unclean. The services here are such a disappointment.,1
95898205,1,Why can't housekeeping do their job? It's not hard to clean a room!,1
95898206,5,I've never had food quite like this at a resort. This was definitely something special.,0
95898207,5,I love this resort! The staff are the best here as they provided everything that my party and I needed for our wedding.,0
95898208,5,Simply amazing and beautiful. The poolside margaritas were amazing.,0

95898213,5,This was amazing! The ambiance and food was superb!,0
95898214,1,Unbelievable! This was awful. I will never be here again with how poor everything was here.,1
95898215,1,"How do you make guests pay for this type of experience? Our spa appointment was moved without notice, and once we got there, it was awful!",1
95898216,1,The spa needs to be taken care of. The water is so hard and the spa workers were unaccommodating to make any changes for us. What a waste.,1
95898217,1,"I am trying to like this place. However, when you food is consistently inedible and your rooms are gross, I can't do it. After five years of being here, I won't ereturn.",1
95898218,4,"It's always a pleasure to say here! I didn't like this year's food specials, but it still gives the best memories.",0
95898219,5,So much fun. I can't begin to describe my experience.,0
95898220,4,I love this place. It was a bit chaotic but overall a great time,0
95898221,1,Never again. Your food is so overcooked at the pool and the drinks are unappetizing.,1
95898222,4,The staff really are incredible. You all are amazing.,0
95898223,5,I loved everything about our stay! Thank you!,0
95898224,5,Hotel with Personality!,0

95898248,1,Your staff is so pretentious. I simply ask a question about the menu and they scoff at me as if I did something wrong. Train your people to be better. This was the worst experience I have ever had in my life.,1

95898259,5,Thank you for such an amazing stay!,0
95898260,1,Very unclean. The rooms smelled of mold and everything in the room felt stale. The air was pungent during our stay.,1
95898261,1,"I know this isn't the hotel's fault for it being noisy in another patron's room, but to not try to helpus find a resolution is absolutely unacceptable. Our stay was absolute hell.",1
95898262,4,Really fun place to be! The beach was amazing!,0
95898263,2,The hotel was unclean when we stayed. Do you not have proper housekeeping?,1
95898264,4,"Very clean hotel, good breakfast, good value for your money. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars... the single bed rooms are small. I did not get a chance to use the pool, but pool room looked extremely clean as well.",0

95898267,5,Lovely all around! The seafood was amazing and the pool was great!,0
95898268,1,This was a horrible stay. The hotel was run down and dirty. We were not able to get to our reserved king room because supposedly the battery in the door was going bad and couldn't get in after going back to the office.,1
95898269,2,Our room was sub-standard. Two of the four lights didn't work. The bath tub and sink needed to be cleaned. They both drained VERY slowly. While showering you had to stand in water up to your ankles. The fitted sheet was on the bed inside out... certainly hope that they didn't turn it over.,1
95898270,2,Not quite what we hoped at all. I wish everything was taken care of a little bit better.,1
95898271,5,The food was amazing here! The steak house was really interesting and had great options for everyone in our party.,0

95898282,5,Fun and exciting beach vibes. Will be coming back again with family!,0
95898283,2,Our toilet was not functioning for the majority of our stay. We tried to move but there was nothing available. They offered us vouchers for another stay but what's the point if the stay is already horrible in the first place?,1
95898284,5,You guys are so amazing. Your staff is phenomenal as they service everything we need when we need it. Thank you!,0
95898285,5,We are so appreciative of your help! You guys did wonderful.,0

95898311,1,Don't be fooled. It’s definitely pretty but that's all it is. The service and food is terrible with nothing to do.,1
95898312,5,It was an unforgettable time! Thank you all again!,0
95898313,3,"Good hotel, but not so crazy about the area as it is so far away from the city.",0
95898314,5,This hotel has everything. Beautiful grounds and interior. We stayed here for 3 nights but wish we had booked longer as we didn't have time to make use of the amazing pool area.,0

95898323,4,"Hotel was just ok nothing special. Was down here for a party weekend so worth it. The town is amazing, because theres so much fun stuff to do there. Great many bars and restaurants.",0
95898324,5,"I stayed here with a couple friends. Very friendly hotel!  The location is far from all the action, but a quick cab ride away... worth the stay. ",0
95898325,4,"The folks here have paid attention to detail and made this a wonderful place to stay. There is Plenty of room for parking, a nice breakfast, comfortable rooms, easy check in and out. ",0
95898326,5," They had a contential breakfast at the hotel and that was nice. It had a great selection with staff that worked really hard the entire time to keep everything stocked, cleaned, and looking nice. It was just a nice hotel all around and we couldn't beat the price. Very happy with our stay here.",0
95898327,5,We had an amazing time!,0
95898328,5,The food was so good and the ambiance was lovely. Will be back soon.,0

95898330,2,"After my business meeting, I came to a room that was not cleaned. Is there no housekeeping here?",1
95898331,1,The spa package is a total ripoff!,1

95898334,5,"My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. ",0
95898335,5,This property was delightful in every way -- the perfect place to celebrate my birthday!,0
95898336,1,"What a bad mistake choosing this hotel.  I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation because we frequent often, but this last experience has been the worst. Overcooked food, and horrible service overall.",1
95898337,4, I would return here for the accommodations and pool area! It's definitely one of the prettier places that I have been to.,0
95898338,3,"this a definitely memorable experience with my family but overall, it wasn't anything too extravagant.",0
95898339,2,We are repeat guests but sadly this will be our last stay as we will be looking to take our family elsewhere. This was our first vacation that we could not wait to get back home.,1
95898340,4,"Stayed for a total of eight days. Rooms spacious and updated recently. Everything in working order. A/C a bit noisy, but working fine. Overall, Hotel is showing its age here and there, but it is good value for the price. ",0
95898341,2,Very strong smell in the hallways I was in the last room on the second floor and the internet did not work They offer storage of luggage service but not allowed to leave the luggage after checkout. Extremely rude clerk who answered me in the checkout,1
95898342,1,Our toilet and bathtubs were creaking allowing us not to sleep. Please do better in maintaining the rooms. This was the worst room ever.,1
95898343,1,I don't even know how this place is still operating. The girls at the checkout desk are rude and confrontational. Their faces depict people that are being forced to work... Not helpful whatsoever. ,1
95898344,5,The most family friendly resort I have been to. Such hospitality!,0
95898345,5,. The service was fast and very friendly. All smiles. I enjoyed being at the pool!,0
95898346,4,I went here with friends from work and we had a good time. They have a small bar area but was good enough for the ten of us. Only drawback was the slow food service as it took over an hour for two small appetizers.,0

95898348,5,I really like this hotel. The staff is friendly helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. It is quiet and allows for a great nights sleep especially after your conventions.,0

95898355,3,"This resort was nice overall, but our meeting could have been much better executed.",0
95898356,4,Our first stay at this location it was ok.. Very nice breakfast not much room to sit though. Found internet ok in lobby but not in the assigned room. Would stay again but need the internet in the room.,0

95898360,1,"I stayed in a room on the 3rd floor. Upon waking up, I found a bed bug on the curtain. After calling the front desk, I was told that finding a bed bug was absolutely impossible. Such a disgusting attitude and room alike.",1

95898362,5,Checking was fast and the staff were friendly. This is a very nice hotel. The room was excellent with comfortable furniture and bed. ,0
95898363,2,"I checked in to the hotel greeted with a smile, which was good.. When I went in to the room, it was stuffy even with the AC on. Which was really, really loud. I could not sleep. And if I turn down the AC, it was too hot.  The bathroom was moldy. The breakfast was bad. The coffee was horrible. All in all, I had to check out after 1 night of my 5 night vacation.",1
95898364,5,"We were thoroughly satisfied with our stay at Holiday Inn Express.  For a budget hotel, the surroundings were clean, freshly painted, and we commented that the bedding was the most comfortable of any we'd slept in.  We would definitely recommend this hotel.",0

95898366,4,"Overall, I enjoy this hotel. I have stayed there a total of 5 times for business purposes. Each stay was for nearly a week. The staff are always warm and welcoming. My bathroom has been ""dirty"" a few times, such as hair in the sink or toilet. But nothing horrible enough to request another room. Overall, great stay.",0
95898367,4," The room was clean and neat, the staff friendly and helpful. I did find the hotel a bit too far from the downtown. When we rented a car we could park it for free at the hotel, which I am told is not always so. ",0

95898375,5,"Centrally located hotel on Hilton Head. This is a lovely, safe facility for the single female traveler. If only they offered small bottles of wine in their snack purchase area (other Hampton Inns have the license), I would say this was perfection :)",0

95898377,5,Third time visiting this hotel!! Great stay will come again!! ,0

95898391,4,The hotel is nice and we have a great room. Lobby is very inviting. The people at this hotel are very friendly What I have really notice is a lack of personnel. I think there are not enough employees for the size of the establishment.,0
95898392,1,"This was my first and it will be my last. I don't believe these review regarding how spectacular the front desk is, when in reality they don't really help.

95898432,1,Tragic stay here. I can'tbelieve anyone would pay for these overpriced rooms that were absolutely filthy.,1
95898433,1,This place makes me upset at the fact that it the spa was lackluster and the food was less than adequate. Never again will I visit your establishment.,1
95898434,2,"The staff were lovely but at the same time, the food was not good at the hotel restaurants. The food was dry and overcooked. Such a shame from a beautiful resort.",1
95898435,1,Why have a place that is so beautiful but just downright awful? Overpriced and underwhelming!,1
95898436,5,The overall ambience at this hotel was outstanding. What made our stay at this facility so pleasant was the staff. From the housekeeping staff to the desk staff the smiles and friendliness were always obvious. ,0
95898437,5,I checked in very late but the staff were very accommodating in making sure we were taken care of that evening.,0
95898438,5,"Stayed here 2 nights for a business/personal trip with my husband and our 2 kids.

95898446,5,We stayed here for an entire week while attending a family reunion right down the road. This place was amazing with great food and fun amentities to enjoy while visiting family.,0
95898447,1,"My husband and I had to stay at this hotel for one night. I have never been to such a terrible place. I  have not seen such a shabby room. The room was disgusting (although the sheets seemed clean). The furniture had spots, tear, and looked like it was picked up off the curb. ",1
95898448,4,Stayed for three nights. The only thing lacking was the quality of the spa package we purchased,0
95898449,4,Very satisfactory and comfortable.very convenient and met all our requirements.,0
95898450,4,The hotel itself feels nice but outdated. Still and overall fun stay.,0
95898451,2,"Very outdated, terrible water pressure, not enough towels in the room for a couple and the AC was very old and loud. ",1
95898452,1,"Absolutely horrible! I was looking for an affordable place to stay for a weekend trip to Watkins Glen and decided to book this place. Worst decision I ever made! I arrived about 10:00pm, had to ring a doorbell to be checked in by a man who came out to the desk in his UNDERWEAR. The room had a musty smell... More",1
95898453,4,Clean and well maintained.,0
95898454,3,"The front desk staff was very helpful. However, it felt like this resort was somewhat lacking. Nothing too mind-blowing.",0
95898455,5,I have stayed at the Lofts on Pearl for the past couple of years following a Bills game. The rooms lack nothing. They are perfect as well as the staff. They are so welcoming and take care of our needs while we are visiting . Beautiful place !!!!!!,0
95898456,4,"Fantastic family accommodations!!! The good - Staff was great! Welcoming, friendly and very accomodating. Beds were very comfortable. Except for the very springy pull out couch. Bathroom was very clean. Location was superb!! ",0
95898457,4,Fun beach resort overall! The food in the hotel restaurants was amazing too.,0

95898459,5,"The staff was very friendly, especially Housekeeping. The breakfast offered a lot of variety. The hotel amenities were great. Great value resort!",0
95898460,5,"Extremely pleased with our hotel stay. We are a family of 5 and recently spent 2 nights at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of our suite and the friendliness of the staff. There is a popcorn machine in the lobby, which my kids loved. We also caught the staff setting out warm chocolate chip cookies in the evenings-YUM! Such a nice homey touch! The free breakfast was outstanding. We traditionally don't expect much from a hotel spread, but this one was the exception. Lots of selections, and the hot options changed from one morning to the next. Breakfast attendant was friendly and helpful, and kept everything well stocked as the crowd ebbed and flowed. The only negatives were an extremely loud family in the room above us that kept us awake until almost midnight. The hotel staff did they best to help and even offered to move us, but we opted not to take them up on the offer. Nothing else the staff could have done to help that situation. I was also disappointed that the hot tub wasn't working, but the kids had a wonderful time in the pool regardless.",0
95898461,5,Great Experience considering the horrible weather we were having. The staff was exceptionally nice and friendly. Breakfast was very good and the location in all was serene.,0
95898462,4,"This Hampton was consistent with my other experiences at their properties, which is why I like staying there. The room was comfortable and well insulated from ambient noise, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the breakfast offered a decent variety of hot/cold items. The one exception was my disappointment with the condition of the bathroom, which had paint peeling on the ceiling, and a tub that was stained from age. It could use a refreshing, and detracted from an otherwise satisfying Hampton experience.",0
95898463,2,The pictures of the hotel looked better on line. The staff was ok not great. No one looked like they wanted to be there.,1
95898464,3,Everything was good. I only spent a short night. I had an early flight the next morning.,0
95898465,1,"Following a fourteen hour drive, we arrived, very tired, to check in at 3 AM. The room had stained carpets, lights that didnt work and things just didnt seem particularly clean. However, the bed was nicely made and we were very tired. I pulled back the bed spread to find rumpled sheets covered in blood. ",1
95898466,3,"Nothing special to recommend this resort, but it's adequate and serviceable.",0
95898467,2,"Everyone was very friendly, however room wasn't super clean and our shower temperature was all over the place while taking a shower. Needs updating and small repairs I think.",1
95898468,2, The elevators need repairing. They are so noisey. You guys have... More,1
95898469,4,This is the second time staying here. The rugs in the hall are getting noticeably worn. It is a clean hotel and the staff are great. Everyone had a smile and said hello. ,0
95898470,3,Definitely chic but nothing special. It's a good vacation stay if you like the beach.,0
95898471,5, Great staff.. Next time we come out here we will stay here.. The bathrooms were very clean and the rooms were not too hot or too cold. Like I said will stay there from now on..,0

95898475,5,"Very clean and pleasant hotel. The noise level almost non existing, always a plus for me! The staff was very professional and catered to my needs without question. The banquet hall was very clean, a great size, well put together, and affordable. I will definitely be doing business with this location again. Thank you for providing me with a home... More",0

95898479,4,"We stayed here and really enjoyed our stay. Nice rooms, clean although the carpet in the room we stayed in needs to be replaced. This hotel did pay attention to our special requests, which rarely happens and sometimes those little things make a BIG difference. We didn't try the breakfast but we will next time we stay here.",0
95898480,5," The hotel staff were polite and courteous. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. During both of our stays, we were the only ones using the pool and that was a bonus. Definitely recommend this resort!",0
95898481,4,"Was in town for a convention.  Room was very nice Super water pressure in the shower, but, very slow drainage. ",0
95898482,5,The bathroom was very clean. The beds were comfortable. I loved the views.,0
95898483,3,The junior suite was spacious but it wasn't anything too special. The resort itself is nice and has a lot of potential.,0
95898484,4,They have a nice breakfast buffet along with other food options for lunch and dinner with their different In hotel resraurants.,0
95898485,5,I had a great experience at this hotel. Everybody is friendly and the rooms are very clean. I utilized the fitness center to help me maintain my work out regiment. Kendra was my favorite employee. I would definitely stay here again because of the ease of access in location and friendly customer service.,0
95898486,5,Came for a weekend with a child. The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful. Pool area was clean and the rooms were very nice. Would definitely recommend. Had no complaints at all. They are located a little off the beaten path but it was nice and quiet.,0
95898487,5,"This was an excellent hotel. Very clean and updated. Nice comfortable beds and covers. The complimentary breakfast had a huge selection and something for everyone. The only draw back was it was on the expensive side, but I guess you get what you pay for because I can't think of anything to complain about. Lol.",0
95898488,5, This hotel will probably be the only one we stay at for our summer vacations. So amazing! Thank you!,0
95898489,4,This was the best.  The decor is upscale contemporay and the front desk staff were cheery and happy to see you. ,0
95898490,5,. The beds were super comfortable after our trip.The amenities were great for our family.,0
95898491,5,We checked in late Friday evening and were warmly and expertly greeted.,0
95898492,4,Having a small fridge was nice. The front desk folks were very friendly. We would stay here again.,0
95898493,2,"If you're a fan of thin pillows and rock hard beds you are home. On a positive note, the room was clean and the towels were soft. Genuinely overpriced",1
95898494,5,Stayed here for 7 nights hotel was amazing and should be rated a 5 star plus everything was perfect,0
95898495,5,The amenities are very nice with very comfortable bedding and living area.,0
95898496,5,Our room  felt like we were staying in a hi-end condo with breathtaking views of the beach. So beautiful!,0
95898497,3,"The issues started the first night. I complained the first night to the front desk and actually a maintenance guy because our toilet kept running. Other than that, we made the best of it. Just make sure to fix your issues before your guests stay here.",0
95898498,5,"Unfortunately, I had pulled my hamstring prior to my arrival and was in extreme pain after walking through 2 airports and pulling my luggage. The hotel staff took me to my room in a wheelchair and brought me ice and other items to assist with my pain. On top of that, they gave me a Get Well card signed by all the staff. ",0
95898499,5,"This is a really lovely resort. And because it has most of anything you need at pretty high quality, it is not cheap. We stayed for two days and enjoyed both beertasting and whiskey/whiskytasting at the restaurants!",0
95898500,4,Stayed here for one night and really enjoyed it. The place is very modern and is being upgraded. The staff couldn't have been any nicer. Great bar with pretty good bar food.The bar tenders were super. Place was very clean. The only problem is you're a little removed from the action but a short Uber/Lyft ride and you're there.Worth going back to next time I'm in San DIegoThank you for your review. We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.,0
95898501,5,My husband has business here and I tagged along. What a fantastic hotel. The service is impeccable. ,0
95898502,4,"We got a couple of connecting suites, very confortable and with all the necesary ammenities. Stayed there for a week. Contemporary and stylish.",0
95898503,4,Beautiful modern king city view suite. A few quirks like 12th floor check in and directions needed to leave. Staff was very nice and helpful 40 per night off site valet parking but it was pretty quick. Walking distance to Gaslight district. Close to waterfront and airport. Overall great value Thank you for your review. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.,0
95898504,3,"Good resort overall. Nothing that screams the best, but is surely quality.",0
95898505,3,It's fair. A resort that does the job and has good amentities. Very beautiful beach though!,0
95898506,2,"Maintenance needs to do a better job. When the bathroom is leaking, please fix it! No one sleeps in a flooded room!",1
95898507,4,The service and people are the perfect. ,0
95898508,5,The hotel is well furnished. My only criticism was the toiletries in the shower and the shower handle are poorly placed. I hit my elbow a few times and the toiletries caddy makes it hard to wash your hair under the shower.,0
95898509,5,I used this hotel for an event we were having and was amazing! The location was perfect since it was literally right on the beach. Everyone enjoyed their stay and I enjoyed how easy it was to coordinate accommodations for 30 people. ,0
95898510,5,Lovely resort! Thank you so much for everything!,0
95898511,4,Overall it was nice. Our room though was a bit tinier than expected for what I paid.,0
95898512,1,"Place is so dirty and not well kept, but what got me the most is how unprofessional the night auditor was!!! He had such a bad attitude I even said to cancel my reservation cause I didn't care for his attitude. ",1
95898513,1,"This has to be by far the nastiest and unkempt hotel I have ever seen! There were stains on everything...The shower curtain, chairs, wall and bed spread. Some of the staff was very rude.",1
95898514,1,"The clerk was extremely slow and after 15 mins, still could not find our paid reservation on her computer.",1
95898515,1,"For a resort, this was awful. The food was atrocious and I could not stand anything of what this place had to offer.",1
95898516,5,"Smallish room--tastefully appointed with touches I've seen in high-end hotels--was cozy and comfortable. The crowning grace, though, was the excellent and helpful staff. The front desk staff was uniformly friendly, interested in helping us enjoy our stay, and full of useful not-in-the-guidebooks information. We'd return to the hotel without hesitation.",0
95898517,5,"Staff was very friendly and helpful, Amenities were nice and our room was a little on the small size but comfortable.",0
95898518,4,Beautiful resort!,0
95898519,2,"I understand that it is quite likely a great improvement over years past, however the refresh is superficial only. The floors still creak and were bowed and the climate control is minimal. The provided window air conditioner has not been serviced in some time and the air was not cool. ",1
95898520,5,"Great location! Even though secluded, there were many things to do! The food was amazing inside the hotel itself!",0
95898521,3,I can tell that the hotel is making serious strides towards improvement and the staff is seriously the highlight of the entire stay. They are wonderful and made us feel welcome during our entire stay. The cleanliness needs to improve however.,0
95898522,5,"I have stayed at all the big hotels in the Union Square (Westin, Hyatt, Hilton, etc ) and a number of boutique offerings as well. This may be my favorite one. The valueIs by far the best in the area. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and the vibe is casual/chic. Huge thumbs up!",0
95898523,5,A wonderful hotel right on the water. The staff at the hotel go beyond the call of duty to be helpful. The rooms are small but very well equipped. The beds are very comfortable. This hotel is a real gem and I can highly recommend it.,0
95898524,5,The hotel was very clean. The staff are all nice.,0
95898525,5," Upon arrival we were promptly attended to and checked in quickly. Vallet took our vehicle and we headed up to our room. Enjoy the Pictures and the hotel, it is in an incredible location!",0
95898526,3,Fairly standard resort that does the job. It’s just okay to be honest.,0
95898527,4,Lovely resort! It was a really good time!,0

95898529,4,The pool is definitely my highlight and is for sure what I would come back to.,0
95898530,5,The food specials they have in the bar and the restaurants are stunning.,0
95898531,5,The views are so stunning. I can't believe how great this place is!,0
95898532,1,"Disgusting spa area. The water is so brackish. I get it, we are at the beach and it may affect the water. But that's even more reason to make sure that everything is taken care of. Please fix it.",1
95898533,4,Great place overall. Transportation to the resort is hit or miss.,0
95898534,5,Wow is all I can say. What an amazing experience.,0
95898535,1,"Our dinner was really bad. My porterhouse was overcooked, my wife's food wasn't seasoned and the cocktails we ordered were overly sweet.",1
95898536,5,This is the best place to be. On a beautiful beach sipping sangria. ,0
95898537,4,This hotel is definitely really good. Only downside is the price.,0
95898538,4,"Really great, but not the best value.",0
95898539,5,Very extravagant. Our suite was impeccable and the ocean view was breathtaking.,0
95898540,5,I can't believe I stayed here! All the staff were so efficient and helpful. Such an amazing time.,0
95898541,4,Staff was great and really work hard. The room was a little untidy.,0
95898542,5,The charcuterie they offered in the bar was amazing. I was there every night.,0
95898543,5,The small bites place in the bar were superb. Amazing overall!,0
95898544,5,Room was perfect for us and the beds were very comfortable. We will certainly come back and do it again in the near future and stay at the same place. Will definitely come for the amenities,0
95898545,5,We had the wet bar suite and it was really spacious and nice for our family.Breakfast was great! Staff was super friendly.,0
95898546,4,"If you are a family traveling with children, you will feel right at home. The proximity to Sea World attracts families of all nationalities...the only time you experience the family confusion is during breakfast. The property itself is new, well staffed and features Hampton's newest ideas as to what they perceive the traveling public desires.Dear frankmJ9377CF,Thank you so much for choosing our property during your trip to Orlando and writing about your recent stay with us!

95898548,5,The staff is very helpful and will assist in giving the guests the best information reegarding the area. I recommend this hotel.,0
95898549,2,Ther were too many hassles during the check in process and rooms not being available multiple times. Delay after delay is the name of the game here.,1
95898550,5,"Stayed at this hotel for business and was delightfully surprised. Along with the beach, it's nice to unwind with a cocktail and a view after a hard day at a convention.",0
95898551,5,This hotel is clean. The staff go out of their way to be kind and made our stay memorable!,0
95898552,5,Great Hotel. Excellent value. Great location. Would definitely stay here again. Includes breakfast with very nice selection. Staff very courteous.,0
95898553,5,the staff is friendly make sure you don't get a room by the elevators the bell will wake you up also make sure you don't eat the plastic apples they leave in a bowl in the meeting room why plastic vs real.,0
95898554,2,"The HVAC did not work properly leading to both of us having a restless night's sleep. The location was great and the room and layout were also ideal. It is a beautifyl hotel however, but man was it hot.",1
95898555,4,Reallly great. Thank you to all of the staff that helped us!,0
95898556,5,Amazing!,0
95898557,4,You guys are so great you helped with literally everything. Just make sure the spa is better!,0
95898558,1,That spa was really bad. Never again. How do you seriously charge all of that money to bring such a lackluster experience to the guests?,1
95898559,5,I love staying here. The hotel still has a concierge lounge and they have always helped us with anything that we needed.,0
95898560,4,"The hotel lobby is beautiful and we enjoyed a few nights using it. There are a few restaurants/bars onsite with lovely options for food. Overall, it was very clean, friendly and a great hotel. ",0
95898561,4,Stayed here for a convention being held in adjacent convention center. VERY convenient to that Convention Center....easy walk. But hotel itself was just ok. Room nothing special.,0
95898562,5,"This hotel was very much like a resort in the city. Indoor and outdoor pools, two racket ball courts, Jacuzzi hot tub, steam room and sauna. The food in the restaurant was really good too. You could spend two or three days here and be totally rejuvenated. I look forward to returning.",0
95898563,5,Really great! I have no complaints and I will we back with my friends and family.,0
95898564,5,"I spent nine days here and must say the people are the most responsive hotel employees I have ever experienced. The Shuttle service was superb. This resulted from the extremely high prices in the dinning facilities within the hotel. That would be the lone drawback to staying here. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy. Again, the best thing about a stay here is the staff you interact with they are the best!",0
95898565,4,"Very comfortable rooms and friendly staff, plus great concierge lounge.",0
95898566,4,"The hotel is great, very nice rooms and a great view. The beach area is quiet, you can walk on the park thats across the street. If you are there for a meeting, event or convention, its even better since hte hotel, as the name says, has its own convention center and you dont even have to go outside! ",0
95898567,4,"Everything was easy to get to, the food was great. The room was large and comfortable and wonderfully maintained. This is the second time around for our group, which means 400 other people enjoyed it too - or we don't comeback!I am so glad you came back and enjoyed the experience again!",0
95898568,5,This is an older hotel but far from beyond it's prime! They have done a fine job of keeping it updated. I love the way the rooms all open up to the main open area.,0
95898569,4, The line for breakfast was quite long all four days I was there- get there early or be prepared to wait.,0
95898570,4,This was a great hotel pick if you want to be away from the craziness of any city you are at. The beach is the best here along with the poolside service.,0
95898571,4,The facility is beautiful and so close to restaurants.(Has one in the atrium) It's a little on the pricey side but its very secure.,0
95898572,5,"This was a nice well run hotel, a little nicer and better run that most in it's class, but the staff were are more sincerely helpful and friendly than any hotel I have ever stayed in.",0
95898573,4,"Everyone there is pleasant, professional and sincere. ",0
95898574,4,"This hotel is nice. The staff is great and we chose to use valet parking. There is parking available on each side of the hotel, however, we opt for valet. This is a very busy hotel with several events (weddings etc...) going on. The rooms are spacious as well as the bath. The bed was too soft for my liking.",0
95898575,3,Never have I spent so much on a hotel that seemed so unsure of itself.,0
95898576,4,"The hotel is convenient to the convention center, connected, and a number of great eating places within minutes of the hotel. The the only drawback was the shuttle service, on every occassion but one it took over 15 minutes for the captain to find a driver, in 2 instances I had to show the driver how to get to the restaurant.",0
95898577,5, Room was large and quite spacious with wrap around windows that offered a nice view. King sized bed and desk and complimentary Internet. Clean and looked to be recently renovated. ,0

95898581,5,"I didn't have the opportunity to dine in the hotel so I can't comment on restaurants or food. Front desk staff was very friendly.The only negative, which I didn't notice but others in my group did, was the noise coming from the open restaurant areas in the lobby.",0
95898582,3,The subfloor of the shower was not good the water pressure was less than satisfactory. I most likely would not stay here again mostly because of the lack of hospitality.,0
95898583,4,Hotel was clean and hotel staff very helpful.,0
95898584,5, the amenities and location along with upgrades makes this an awesome place to stay! Shopping is also inside the hotel with several cheaper places to eat in the connecting building. The staff was excellent and the convention rooms were of good quality.,0
95898585,5,We experienced very good customer service in all key areas. The onsite parking was extensive and easy to deal with.,0
95898586,5,"I have traveled for business a lot, and I've come to expect little from convention hotels. So I was delightfully surprised. All in all, the staff was courteous, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the experience was overwhelmingly positive.",0

95898598,5,What a great looking resort!,0
95898599,5,This place is so beautiful and they honestly have the best hospitality service that I have ever seen.,0
95898600,1,That is no spa. To charge such high prices for low-quality treatment is outrageous. Never again.,1
95898601,5,My anniversary here with my husband was the best. Thank you!,0
95898602,5,I will return here! The beach is really something else here!,0
95898603,1,This place is distasteful. Especially the spa. I can't believe how much you charge for a simple thirty minute massage.,1
95898604,5,So serene and peaceful! The poolside food service really made my day!,0
95898605,5,Great menu options for both food and drink! Will never get over how amazing this place is.,0
95898606,5,The resort is marvelous. The governor's suite provided such a great place for my family.,0
95898607,4,The views are amazing. I just wish we had a little bit more of a view of the ocean.,0
95898608,5,So beautiful! I can't wait to come back!,0
95898609,5,I love this place. I can't wait to come back to see what foods they will have the next time!,0
95898610,4,Our conference was a success and it was really pleasant.,0
95898611,4,Really standard experience. The food and drink was the best part. My favorite was the seasonal fish.,0
95898612,3,The food was outstanding. The best steak I 've had in a long time. The spa though was atrocious. This place needs to step up their spa game.,0
95898613,5,Everyone was so helpful! I can't thank the staff enough for taking care my every request.,0
95898614,5,Pleasant and beautiful place overall. All of the staff had smiles on their faces and always made my day.,0
95898615,4,Good service and food. Our room was not resrocked when we first arrived.,0
95898616,3,The room was just okay. It seemed a little run down and our AC would give out. Everything else was impeccable.,0
95898617,1,What a beautiful hellscape. It's so pretty coupled with terrible service and disgusting food.,1
95898618,1,Overpriced and filthy. Your check in is so slow and the rooms we were put in were all riddled with crumbs and dust.,1
95898619,1,My TV was broken and the maintenance team was inconsiderate.,1
95898620,5,The staff are the highlight of this place. So accommodating and helpful.,0
95898621,1,I will not be coming back. I have mobility handicaps and I was rushed out of my room for check out. Everything was great until that point.,1
95898622,4,Really pleasant and fun. Just a bit pricey,0
95898623,1,This place has me so upset. Housekeeping did a horrible clean of my room and went into my room with my do not disturb sign on the door.,1
95898624,5,Exceeded my expectations. The ribeye and old fashioned is so delicious.,0
95898625,4,This is a fun resort with good amenities. I enjoyed my stay.,0
95898626,1,The spa was so bad. I can't believe how unprofessional and unkept the spa is.,1
95898627,1,The conference rooms were not set up for my meetings in time and I was given excuse after excuse by the event manager. This has been so unprofessional.,1
95898628,5,The ocean front suite is so beautiful and ,0
95898629,4,Really pretty views and caring staff. The meals I had were somewhat salty.,0
95898630,4,What a pretty resort. The staff is helpful in every aspect.,0
95898631,5,The boutique stores are so cute! I love the gifts that you have to sell!,0
95898632,4,Pricey but worth it!,0
95898633,1,I sent my food back three times because each time it was overcooked. Also my server was outright mean to me.,1
95898634,1,"The spa staff were so uncaring. I understand if it's busy, but they simply did not want to help with my simplest requests.",1
95898635,5,The chicken taco special was amazing! Poolside is the way to go!,0
95898636,5,"The concierge was amazing! They are informative and professional, setting up acommodations for us outside of the hotel as well.",0
95898637,5,"Simply outstanding. The views, the food, and the overall vibe cannot be beaten.",0
95898638,5,My mind has been blown. The staff took care of us at every step.,0
95898639,4,The Jensen Suite was nice but smaller than expected. Regardless it was amazing.,0
95898640,5,The ocean front room is crazy. It is definitely the highlight of my trip.,0
95898641,5,"The staff is so fast and efficient! Even when busy, they know how to be efficient with all of the guests.",0
95898642,5,The spicy margaritas and other cocktails are really delicious.,0
95898643,5,What an amazing experience. I will never forget these past few days.,0
95898644,1,I am absolutely infuriated. I paid for a spa package for them to tell me I can't use it because it was overbooked. Unprofessional.,1
95898645,4,The breakfast buffet was amazing even though a bit pricey.,0
95898646,5,"If I could, I would stay here indefinitely. It is very beautiful with really good food, drinks, and amenities.",0
95898647,5,The beach is so relaxing. To be able to order drinks poolside is even better.,0
95898648,4,Everything was good. The room view was a little underwhelming though.,0
95898649,1,My room was filthy upon arrival and it took 30 minutes for someone just to come and barely clean it.,1
95898650,5,Such an extravagent experience. I will be returning,0
95898651,5,My kids and I were so happy to be here. This was amazing!,0
95898652,4,The conference overall was a success. There were a few hiccups but the staff accommodated.,0
95898653,4,"The spa was a little underwhelming, but overall it was a great time.",0
95898654,5,My experience here was simply the best. The mushroom risotto was absolutely the best dish I had here.,0
95898655,4,It was a pleasant experience.,0
95898656,4,Pretty good for what we paid for. I wish there was more to do.,0

95898658,5,Very family friendly!,0
95898659,4,It was a fun experience to be here with the family. The beach was nice and everyone was very sweet to us.,0
95898660,1,Our experience was not at all what we hoped. The food was awful and our room was a mess. I can't believe how much we spent and how little value we received.,1
95898661,1,"This was atrocious. I don't like to complain, but this was really one of the worst experiences I've had. No one came to our aid when we needed it, everything felt dirty, and none of the amenities were even at par.",1
95898662,5,Really great! I have no complaints and I will we back with my friends and family.,0
95898663,4,Wonderful place. A little bit outdated but still a good beach place to relax.,0
95898664,5,Never thought I'd experience anything like this. Truly outstanding!,0
95898665,3,The experience here is just above average. Everything is what you expect it to be here. Nothing mind-blowing,0

95898667,5,This the best resort I've ever been to. So beautiful and the people here areso helpful and hospitable!,0
95898668,5,Lovely job all around. I love this place and I never want to leave!,0
95898669,1,"It's really bad. I was told that there were so many great things about this resort and nothing has been even remotely positive. The food is bad, the spa amenities are broken, and it's just not a good time. this place needs to be better.",1
95898670,4,"Pretty good I will say. The food, especially breakfast here, is pretty special.",0

95898673,4,Great experience for great value. Much love goes out to this resort.,0
95898674,5,Our wedding party enjoyed every aspect of this resort. The catering expecially was amazing along with the bar cocktails that were prepared for us.,0
95898675,1,Never again will we come here. Repeatedly have we asked to get our room cleaned for the staff to only steam our sheets and nothing else. There is no care here for the guests.,1
95898676,5,Such a beautiful place! The concierge was especially helpful as they provided everything we needed in a timely manner.,0
95898677,1,The front desk was awful. I don’t understand why you would hire such terrible front desk staff that do not care about guest experience..,1
95898678,1,I feel sick after being here. The outdoor food stand made me feel sick along with the dirty rooms. It's like the vents aren't clean.,1
95898679,1,The spa is the reason why you are getting a poor rating. Fix your amenities and train your staff better.,1
95898680,5,Lovely resort. I will always be happy coming here! The staff as always take care of my family and I.,0
95898681,1,"Dirty. For paying over 700 dollars a night, it at minimum needs to be clean.",1
95898682,5,Really beautiful views and accommodating staff. Good job!,0
95898683,4,Our business meeting went according to plan and the service provided was more than adequate. Thank you!,0
95898684,5,We are so appreciative of everything the staff does here. They are truly the stars of the resort.,0
95898685,1,What a distasteful experience! Everything is so overpriced with the lackluster service!,1
95898686,5,Your services here are unparalleled! The beach is the best part about this resort.,0

95898694,5,The staff and service is unbeatable here!,0
95898695,4,Rooms were unclean when we came in but the housekeeping made it brand new. The front desk apologized and made it up by providing free amenities. They really do go above and beyond.,0
95898696,5,The pool was really nice to have the kids be out there and play. Definitely a highlight.,0
95898697,5,The hotel amenities that were beachside cannot be beaten here.,0
95898698,5,I want to be here all the time. It is so beautiful and the staff here really are caring.,0
95898699,4,Really great. The meeting we had was taken care of nicely with the food and drink provided.,0
95898700,1,This was an upsetting find of a resort. Our rooms were not cleaned properly. We relocated three times to new rooms and each and every time our rooms were filthy.,1
95898701,3,"It was a nice stay overall. The spa however, was definitely not the best, but it was made up by the fact that it was beautiful and things were taken care of quickly.",0
95898702,1,"You all need to do better. If I can't enjoy my dinner in peace, then there is no way I am returning. Things need to be handled here. It should not be expected for the guest to take care of their own problems.",1
95898703,1,Gross and awful. The spa made me so angry and there was nothing to accommodate my dietary restrictions.,1
95898704,2,This resort was a letdown. The spa was not good and the in room dining service was just okay. It is a very beautiful place but that's all it is. It’s just a ,1
95898705,1,"My bags were lost, the front desk were incredibly rude, and the bar food and drink that you tried to make it up with was just downright terrible. Never again will I stay here.",1
95898706,5,I will be back. This is amazing with all of the innovative food items at the pool and the lovely amenities.,0
95898707,5,This resort is such a great time! I can't believe how beautiful it is and amazing the staff are.,0
95898708,1,The spa is absolutely awful. I can't believe you charge over 90 dollars for mediocre massages.,1
95898709,5,Wow! This is all I can say because everything is so perfect! I love the aesthetic!,0
95898710,5,I cannot begin to describe the amazing time we had. Absolutely breathtaking.,0
95898711,5,The food was impeccable. The seafood specials that were provided were absolutely phenomenal.,0
95898712,4,This a lovely spot to host any type of event. The event staff really do a great job and the amenitites to provide to event guests are nice as well.,0
95898713,5,The concierge team provided so much and made it such a personal and lovely stay for my family and I. I can't thank them enough.,0
95898714,5,Thank you for the great time!,0
95898715,4,Lovely place. The breakfast buffest is definitely the place to be to pick yourself back up.,0
95898716,4,Pretty good resort overall! I was pleasntly surprised about the service and their efficiency!,0
95898717,3,Standard resort with good amentities. It's pretty confusing to navigate though.,0
95898718,5,It's such a good place to be with friends and family. They even have beach amenities for guests!,0
95898719,5,It can't get better. The poolside bar is definitely my go to when I come back.,0
95898720,4,The staff was wonderful here. ,0
95898721,3,"It was a good stay. Unfortunately, my room was messy when we came in and the in room dining was not good",0
95898722,1,Awful! Don't provide in-room dining anymore. Everything was disgusting.!,1
95898723,1,"To be frank, this was an awful stay hosted by an incompent front desk team. You can't tell me what I experienced here when I was the one who experienced it. You are downright in the wrong and need to be fired.",1
95898724,1,It's not good. I had high hopes and I was wrong. Your team needs to do better in providing better service.,1
95898725,5,I can't wait to come back here and take my family to your beach! It's so much fun!,0
95898726,1,How do I get bumped off of my spa treatment? What kind of place are you running here?,1
95898727,4,This is such a fun resort. There are things I would change but overall it was pleasant!,0
95898728,1,"I really don't like to complain, but when there are bugs and hair in our supposedly clean room, something needs to be said. ",1
95898729,5,I can't thank you all enough for how wonderful you made my birthday party here!,0
95898730,4,What a great place to be in the summer. The amenities around the hotel itself are very fun.,0
95898731,1,Grossly overrated hotel. The service alone is not deserving of anything higher than a 1 star rating.,1
95898732,1,Your staff is so pretentious. I simply ask a question about the menu and they scoff at me as if I did something wrong. Train your people to be better. This was the worst experience I have ever had in my life.,1
95898733,5,Simply world class! You guys do everything right here!,0
95898734,4,Really great resort with lovely food options. The drinks made at the bar are especially delicious.,0

95898737,4,Really great experience to be here!,0
95898738,1,Never again will my family and I come here. This place was overpriced and unclean. The services here are such a disappointment.,1
95898739,1,Why can't housekeeping do their job? It's not hard to clean a room!,1
95898740,5,I've never had food quite like this at a resort. This was definitely something special.,0

95898747,5,This was amazing! The ambiance and food was superb!,0
95898748,1,Unbelievable! This was awful. I will never be here again with how poor everything was here.,1
95898749,1,"How do you make guests pay for this type of experience? Our spa appointment was moved without notice, and once we got there, it was awful!",1
95898750,1,The spa needs to be taken care of. The water is so hard and the spa workers were unaccommodating to make any changes for us. What a waste.,1
95898751,1,"I am trying to like this place. However, when you food is consistently inedible and your rooms are gross, I can't do it. After five years of being here, I won't ereturn.",1
95898752,4,"It's always a pleasure to say here! I didn't like this year's food specials, but it still gives the best memories.",0
95898753,5,So much fun. I can't begin to describe my experience.,0
95898754,4,I love this place. It was a bit chaotic but overall a great time,0
95898755,1,Never again. Your food is so overcooked at the pool and the drinks are unappetizing.,1
95898756,4,The staff really are incredible. You all are amazing.,0
95898757,5,I loved everything about our stay! Thank you!,0

95898793,5,Thank you for such an amazing stay!,0
95898794,1,Very unclean. The rooms smelled of mold and everything in the room felt stale. The air was pungent during our stay.,1
95898795,1,"I know this isn't the hotel's fault for it being noisy in another patron's room, but to not try to helpus find a resolution is absolutely unacceptable. Our stay was absolute hell.",1
95898796,4,Really fun place to be! The beach was amazing!,0
95898797,2,The hotel was unclean when we stayed. Do you not have proper housekeeping?,1
95898798,4,"Very clean hotel, good breakfast, good value for your money. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars... the single bed rooms are small. I did not get a chance to use the pool, but pool room looked extremely clean as well.",0
95898799,4,The front desk clerk was strangely short with me. But everything else was nice.,0

95898801,5,Lovely all around! The seafood was amazing and the pool was great!,0
95898802,1,This was a horrible stay. The hotel was run down and dirty. We were not able to get to our reserved king room because supposedly the battery in the door was going bad and couldn't get in after going back to the office.,1
95898803,2,Our room was sub-standard. Two of the four lights didn't work. The bath tub and sink needed to be cleaned. They both drained VERY slowly. While showering you had to stand in water up to your ankles. The fitted sheet was on the bed inside out... certainly hope that they didn't turn it over.,1
95898804,2,Not quite what we hoped at all. I wish everything was taken care of a little bit better.,1
95898805,5,The food was amazing here! The steak house was really interesting and had great options for everyone in our party.,0
95898806,4,It's really a cute hotel with beauty and standards. So nice!,0

95898808,4,Everything was pretty good! No compplaints at all.,0
95898809,3,It was a pretty standard resort experience. The best thing here is the beaach.,0
95898810,3,Nothing too mind-blowing. The rooms do the job and the food was pretty good at least.,0
95898811,1,I can't believe how awful this was. It was really awful all and all.,1
95898812,5,Excellent hotel so beautiful,0
95898813,4,"Loved the room, it was cute, cozy, and comfortable!",0
95898814,5,Very good resort with lovely amenities! You guys do great,0
95898815,3,Please fix your spa. Other than that it was a great time here.,0
95898816,5,Fun and exciting beach vibes. Will be coming back again with family!,0
95898817,2,Our toilet was not functioning for the majority of our stay. We tried to move but there was nothing available. They offered us vouchers for another stay but what's the point if the stay is already horrible in the first place?,1
95898818,5,You guys are so amazing. Your staff is phenomenal as they service everything we need when we need it. Thank you!,0
